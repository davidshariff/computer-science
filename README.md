# Computer Science in JavaScript

This open source code contains the fundamental data structures and algorithms, written in JavaScript.

Front-end engineers should grasp a mixture of technologies and methodologies from JavaScript, CSS, HTML to design patterns, MVC/MVVM, browser performance and names.

However, data structures and algorithms are often ignored. Programmers may not use data structures and algorithms on a day to day basis; therefore, user interfaces are becoming more complex and feature-rich.

Every front end engineer should be able to grasp the fundamentals of the following:

## Data Structures

* Binary Trees
* Doubly Linked Lists
* HashTables
* MaxHeaps
* Queues
* Singly Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Tries

## Sorting Algorithms

* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
